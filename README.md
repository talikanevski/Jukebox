# Jukebox
App Jukebox designed for Android Basics by Google Nanodegree Program. 4rd project.
The goal of this project was to design and layout the flow for the structure of a Music Player app. 
Note that for this project, the app does not actually need to play music. 
This app is able to: 
Create new activities,
Use explicit Intents to link between activities,
Use OnClickListeners to add behavior to buttons using Java code,
Create Custom Class,
Loop through an ArrayList,
Populate a ListView or GridView with an ArrayAdapter,
The app containts of 3 activities: "Play Random", "Choose some songs you like", and "Favorites".
User can change his/her mind about favorite songs in every activity, and the app will remember the choise (while the user is using the app)
